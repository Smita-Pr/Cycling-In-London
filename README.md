How to increase the uptake of cycling in London

London’s Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID) is the world’s largest and most comprehensive database of cycling infrastructure, containing comprehensive details of cycling infrastructure in the Capital. The CID is intended to address barriers to cycling by providing Londoners with clear and accurate information about cycling infrastructure, helping them plan cycle journeys with confidence. The CID is a core part of the Cycling Action Plan , which sets out how TfL, boroughs and others will work together to make London the world’s best big city for cycling.
The CID Dataset contains information about the line assets and point assets that constitute the infrastructure available for cyclists in London.
